            Our cherry ice cream is really delicious of flavor and taste.
            Cherry ice cream is a common ice cream flavor in the United States consisting of typical ice cream ingredients and cherries. Whole or sliced or chopped cherries are used, and cherry juice or cherry juice concentrate is sometimes used as an ingredient.
