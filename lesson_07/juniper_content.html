    <p>Juniperus virginiana is a dense slow-growing coniferous evergreen tree with a conical or subcylindrical shaped crown[8] that may never become more than a bush on poor soil, but is ordinarily from 5–20 metres (16–66 feet) tall, with a short trunk 30–100 centimetres (12–39 inches) in diameter, rarely to 27 m (89 ft) in height and 170 cm (67 in) in diameter.</p>
